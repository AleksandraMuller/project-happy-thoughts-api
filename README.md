# Project Happy Thoughts API ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è

In this project I used Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

## In this project, you will find:

Usage of POST requests to send data to API
Storing data in database from POST requests
Validation of data and ensuring database contains only 'good' data

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning üî®

Tools I used in this project include: MongoDb, Mongoose library, JavaScript ES6, Express and Postman for testing.
